# The Azure Developer CLI doesn't support deleting Entra ID resources yet, so we have to do it in a hook.

# We're using a predown hook because the environment variables are (sometimes) empty in a postdown hook.
# The Entra ID resources have a custom tag "azd-env-id: <environment-id>", so we can find and delete them.
